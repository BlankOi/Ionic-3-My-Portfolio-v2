                    My goal is to write clean, highest performance and test covered code in order to provide smooth and bugs free software. Back in days I was working a lot with pure Javascript, Later jQuery and jQuery Mobile and of course other front-end framework available
                    out there. But now then I have started to use AngularJS and of course Ionic Framework. Using and creating web components is the future web development, that is where I am heading.

                    This Portfolio app is build using Ionic framework. Development time of hybrid app has decreased from months to weeks. Back then (when I learn java) there was no such tools and it usually took couple months to build app, because you needed to build your
                    own components that you would get out of the box if you would in native apps development.

                    Good UX design makes efficient. You can have all the functionality that user needs and more but if your app is hard to understand and to use, then it will be useless. My new field of study is how UX design is done, what methods is used in order to achieve
                    it and that is is measure to evaluate it. And I believe, with my efford, I can go much further and improve my skills to meet industry needs.
